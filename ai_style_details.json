Now you can deploy an AI Style website directly on your WordPress site with the AI_Style WordPress theme! This fully function theme incorporates generic styling inspired by the latest crop of AI chat interface websites. While AI_Style can be used by itself as a traditional WordPress theme, it's recommended you actually turn on the AI by installing the Cacbot plugin."
