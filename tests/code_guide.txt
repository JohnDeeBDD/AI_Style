We are building a WordPress theme that replicates the Chat-GPT user interface.

Our development process follows Test Driven Development (TDD).

For each task the user assigns to you, you should first create a failing Codeception acceptance test to test the implementation of the feature.

For each new feature, we begin by creating a Codeception acceptance test. Example:

/var/www/html/wp-content/themes/ai_style/tests/acceptance/ScreenCaptureCept.php

The ScreenCaptureCept.php test is also useful for capturing a visual snapshot of the UI during development.

For every new JavaScript feature, we should create a small, atomic file. Example template`:
/var/www/html/wp-content/themes/ai_style/src/AI_Style/ai-style.js_src/template.js

Each new function must be imported and called from:
/var/www/html/wp-content/themes/ai_style/src/AI_Style/ai-style.js_src/ai-style.js

When any Codeception acceptance test is executed, the JavaScript files are automatically compiled using Spack.
