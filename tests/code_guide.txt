For every JS feature, we should create an atomic file like:
/var/www/html/wp-content/themes/ai_style/src/AI_Style/ai-style.js_src/template.js

That newly created function should be included and called from:
/var/www/html/wp-content/themes/ai_style/src/AI_Style/ai-style.js_src/ai-style.js

When any Codeception acceptance test is run, the JS files are automatically compiled with Spack.

Or you can compile manually with:
npx spack entry=/src/AI_Style/ai-style.js_src/ai-style.js output=/src/AI_Style

One useful command line test to capture the local UI's appearance is:
bin/codecept run acceptance ScreenCaptureCept.php -vvv
which produces output here:
