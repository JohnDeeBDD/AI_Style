We are building a WordPress theme where the UI is similiar to commercial LLM providers like Chat-GPT, Gemini, and Grok. We map WordPress features to the AI chat interactions. i.e. each "chat" is a "post", and the converstaions are stored in the naitive WordPress comment system.

The next feature is enabling the user's ability to create a new "cacbot-conversation". A "cacbot-conversation" is a custom post type that is sometimes enabled by a plugin. If it is enabled, it will appear in the wordpress admin bar in #wp-admin-bar-new-content . The typical behavior of WordPress is that when the user hovers over "New", then clicks "Cacbot Conversation" the browser launches into "/post-new.php?post_type=cacbot-conversation" . We want to create a JS function alled createNewCacbotConversation that overrides this behavior. What the new bahavior should do is call the api in @functions.php /ai-style/cacbot-conversation . This API creates a new "cacbot-conversation" and does a few other things. After your function calls the API and creates a new "cacbot-converstaion", redirect the user to that post.
