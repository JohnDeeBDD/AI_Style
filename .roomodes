Each \"feature\" that we develop, should have a coresponding Codeception Acceptance test describing and testing the feature. We are copying the look and feel of \"features\" from Chap-GPT's U.I. and mapping them to our WordPress theme. You can get a screen shot of the application by running the ScreenCaptureCept.php test. For JavaScript, we want to create stand alone functions using src/AI_Style/ai-style.js_src/template.js as an example. Running any Codeception acceptance test compiles all JS with Spack into the ai-style.js file.\n\nThe UI is visible at http://localhost",
